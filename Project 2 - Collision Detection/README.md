# Project 2 Writeup:

## 0. Performance improvements:
The most important result in this writeup is the performance we obtain with every new algorithm. 

Here, the performance and speedup is given per adjustment.

### Serial performance improvements:

| Description | Execution time (s) | Speedup (relative) | Speedup (absolute) |
| - | - | - | - |
| SnailSpeed's implementation (naive) | | | |
| | | | |

### Parallel performance improvements:

| Description | Execution time (s) | Speedup (relative) | Speedup (absolute) |
| - | - | - | - |
| SnailSpeed's implementation (naive) | | | |
| | | | |
