# RUNNING THE PROFILERS:
follow instructions listed on:
https://gperftools.github.io/gperftools/cpuprofile.html
https://codearcana.com/posts/2013/02/26/introduction-to-using-profiling-tools.html

The main difference is using the -lprofiler flag during linking (DFLAGS), which works for both gcc and clang. This only seems to work when 'brew install gpperftools'. There is the bare pprof and also the go tool pprof. 

Building:
make clean
make sort PROFILE=1
CPUPROFILE=out.prof ./sort
pprof --pdf ./sort out.prof > out.pdf

Symbols not showing? See: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/pprof-wont-show-symbols/24241/2
Problem is partially solved with flag -Wl,-no_pie

-Wl,-no_pie -fno-omit-frame-pointer -Wl,-export_dynamic
